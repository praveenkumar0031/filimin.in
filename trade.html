                Trading stocks can be a fascinating and lucrative way to grow your wealth. However, the stock market can be daunting for beginners, especially with the complex strategies, platforms, and tools available. New traders enter the market daily, but many fail to achieve their full potential because of a lack of knowledge, preparation, and proper risk management.
