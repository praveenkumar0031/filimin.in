            What Is Debt?
            <p>
                Debt is something, usually money, owed by one party to another. Debt is used by many individuals and companies to make large purchases that they could not afford under other circumstances. Unless a debt is forgiven by the lender, it must be paid back, typically with added interest.

            How Debt Works:
            <ul>
                <li>The most common forms of debt are loans, including mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans, as well as credit cards.</li>
                <li>The terms of the loan will also stipulate the amount of interest that the borrower is required to pay, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. Interest compensates the lender for taking on the risk of the loan.</li>
                <li>Credit cards and lines of credit operate a little differently. </li>
                <li>The borrower is assigned a credit limit and they can use their credit card or credit line repeatedly as long as they don't exceed that limit.</li>

            HOW TO PAY OFF DEBT
            <p>
                The best way to stay out of debt trouble is to have a plan for paying it off. That starts with not taking on too much debt in the first place.

For example, consumers should pay attention to their credit utilization ratio, also known as a debt-to-limit ratio.<br><br> That's the amount of debt they currently owe as a percentage of the total amount of credit they have available to them. For example, if someone has two credit cards with a combined credit limit of $10,000, and they currently owe $5,000 on those cards, their credit utilization ratio is 50%.<br><br>

Lenders typically prefer that consumers keep their credit utilization ratios below 30%, and credit scores penalize individuals for exceeding that level.

The fastest way to pay off debt is to devote a greater portion of your income to monthly debt payments, ideally paying off credit card debts in full each month before any interest charges kick in. <br><br>If you need to prioritize, experts generally recommend paying off your highest interest debts first and working your way down from there.

You can also consolidate several debts into one, which may make sense if the new loan carries a lower interest rate. Similarly, you may be able to transfer your credit card balances to another card with a lower interest rate or, ideally, a 0% interest rate for a period of time.
