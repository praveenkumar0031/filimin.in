            What Is a Asset?
            <p>
                An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit.

Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet. <br><br>They're classified as current, fixed, financial, and intangible. <br><br>They are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's operations.

An asset can be thought of as something that, in the future, can generate cash flow, reduce expenses, or improve sales, regardless of whether it's manufacturing equipment or a patent. 
         <br><br>What Are Examples of Assets?<br><br>
         Personal assets can include a home, land, financial securities, jewelry, artwork, gold and silver, or your checking account. Business assets can include such things as motor vehicles, buildings, machinery, equipment, cash, and accounts receivable.   </p>
