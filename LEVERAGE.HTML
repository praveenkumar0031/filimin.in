            What Is a Leverage?
            <p>
                Leverage gives traders the ability to trade larger value contracts while putting down relatively smaller amounts upfront. This provides traders with greater efficiency for their capital and also allows them to increase their exposure without needing additional capital. Leverage can help magnify your gains from trading, but it's also important to understand that leverage also amplifies your potential losses.

    While spot trading of crypto using margin is prohibited in the United States for most investors, derivatives offer investors an alternative path for trading with leverage.

            Types of Margin :
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Margin: Initial margin is the amount you must deposit to initiate a position on a futures contract. Typically, the exchange sets the initial margin amount for futures contracts. However, an FCM (Futures Commission Merchant) may require that you deposit additional funds beyond the initial margin requirement.</li>
                <li>Maintenance Margin: The maintenance margin or maintenance margin requirement (MMR) is the amount of money needed in your account at any given time in order to maintain an open position. If your balance dips below the maintenance margin, your position(s) can be liquidated. Maintenance margins are typically lower than initial margins, however the exact amount can vary as it is set by the exchange. </li>
