            What Is Simple Interest ?
            <p>
                Simple interest is an interest charge that borrowers pay lenders for a loan. <br><br>It is calculated using the principal only and does not include compounding interest. Simple interest relates not just to certain loans. It's also the type of interest that banks pay customers on their savings accounts.
                <BR><BR>
                    Simple Interest=P×r×n
                    <BR></BR>
where:
P=Principal
r=Interest rate
n=Term of loan, in years

            Which Will Pay Out More Over Time, Simple or Compound Interest?
            <p>Compound interest will always pay more after the first payment period. Suppose you borrow $10,000 at a 10% annual interest rate with the principal and interest due as a lump sum in three years. Using a simple interest calculation, 10% of the principal balance gets added to your repayment amount during each of the three years. That comes out to $1,000 per year, which totals $3,000 in interest over the life of the loan.</p>
