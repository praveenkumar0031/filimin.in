            What Is Credit?
            <p>
                Credit is the ability to borrow money under the agreement that you’ll repay the debt later. Credit agreements typically come with repayment terms that include when payments will be due, plus any interest and fees you’ll need to pay. Credit can also refer to an individual’s history of borrowing and repaying debt.
