            What Is a Loan?
            <p>
                The term loan refers to a type of credit vehicle in which a sum of money is lent to another party in exchange for future repayment of the value or principal amount. In many cases, the lender also adds interest or finance charges to the principal value, which the borrower must repay in addition to the principal balance.
<BR><BR>
Loans may be for a specific, one-time amount, or they may be available as an open-ended line of credit up to a specified limit. Loans come in many different forms including secured, unsecured, commercial, and personal loans.

            <ul>
                <li>Principal: This is the original amount of money that is being borrowed.</li>
                <li>Loan Term: The amount of time that the borrower has to repay the loan. </li>
                <li>Loan Payments: The amount of money that must be paid every month or week in order to satisfy the terms of the loan. Based on the principal, loan term, and interest rate, this can be determined from an amortization table.</li>
                <li>Interest Rate: The rate at which the amount of money owed increases, usually expressed in terms of an annual percentage rate (APR)..</li>
